# neocube

This is our "neocube" script sw_cube.py . sw_cube.py and swc.py class are based on the python port "cubebit.py".

The python script sw_cube.py works on RPi Zero (1/2) and Raspberry Pi 2/3/B/+ with the "cubebit.py" python port for slices based on 4tronix neopixel cubes. It is only a demo what's possible. 

"swc.py" is our own class symplifing squares and cubes.
