# neocube

This is the "neocube" script "sw_cube.py" and "swc.py" class based on the python port "cubebit.py".

The python script "sw_cube.py" works on Raspberry Pi 2/3/B/+ with the "cubebit.py" python port for slices based on 4tronix neopixel cubes. It is only a demo what's possible. 

"swc.py" is our own class symplifing squares and cubes.
